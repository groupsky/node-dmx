# Trivy Ignore File
#
# This file allows you to suppress specific vulnerabilities from Trivy scans.
# Use this for false positives or accepted risks that have been reviewed.
#
# Format: CVE-ID or vulnerability ID, one per line
# Lines starting with # are comments
#
# Example:
# CVE-2024-12345  # False positive: vulnerability in build-only dependency
# CVE-2024-67890  # Accepted risk: requires physical hardware access (documented in SECURITY.md)
#
# Best Practices:
# 1. Include a comment explaining WHY each CVE is ignored
# 2. Link to related issue/PR if applicable
# 3. Set a review date for accepted risks
# 4. Never ignore CRITICAL vulnerabilities without security team approval
#
# Current exceptions:
# (none - Alpine base and minimal dependencies have low false positive rate)
